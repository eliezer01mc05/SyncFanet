// <b> The SAORS Routing-Reply Message </b>

// This is an extension of the DYMO_RM message for replying to the
// request for a path towards a destination. It includes two more fields,
// namely the searched destination and the replying node's probability
// of encountering this destination. This extra address field is
// included since the replying node has to enter its address as the
// original address. This was the initial nodes that transmitted the
// SAORS_RREQ will be able to differantiate whether the replies
// received define a path or an opportunity of meeting the requested
// destination, according to whether the seatched field in the 
// SOARS_RREPis empty or not.
