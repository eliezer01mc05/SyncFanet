 The TrafGen module is an all-purpose traffic generator which can be used with the INET framework. Using a flexible xml-based parameter structure, the generator can model all kinds of traffic, for example cbr traffic, on-off-traffic or exponentially distributed traffic. Traffic patterns can also be changed dynamically during the simulation.

 '''Traffic Patterns:'''

 The generator supports (among others) cbr traffic, on-off-traffic and exponentially distributed traffic. Please see the parameter section for an overview of exactly what kinds of traffic can be modeled with the generator.
 Please also note that trace files are not supported.

 '''Usage:'''

 The class TrafGen is an abstract base class. This means you HAVE to subclass from it in order to use it in a simulation. The only element required in that subclass is the function sendTraf(), which receives the message to be sent and the destination in a character string as parameters and has to translate the destination to an address its lower layer can understand.

 An example how this can be achieved can be found in the folder Isabel/Applications/Mobile/DymoTestApp.cpp.

 '''Parameter configuration:'''

 The traffic generator understands the following parameters:
 * packet size in byte: can be a constant number or a distribution (i.e. exponential(10)), just like supported in omnetpp.ini files (section 3.7.8 of the OMNeT++ manual)
 * inter departure times in seconds: can be a constant number or a distribution
 * first packet time in seconds: can be a constant number or a distribution
 * destination: can be any host that is present in your simulation, e.g. host[5] or MobileHost[2]. Wildcards are only supported inside the array brackets (e.g. host[*]). If a wildcard is present, a random member of the specified host array is chosen. You can use a destination of -1 to indicate a broadcast.
 * on and off length in seconds: can be constant numbers or distributions. These parameters are only necessary if the generated traffic should be on-off-traffic.
 * inter departure time used during off-traffic periods: can be a constant number or a distribution. This parameter is not mandatory. If it is left out, no traffic will be generated during off periods
 * identical traffic destinations during on intervals: if this parameter is set to true, all packets generated during an on interval will be sent to the same destination host. At the beginning of the next on interval, the destination is evaluated again. This parameter is not mandatory. If it is left out, a value of false is assumed.

 The parameters are gathered in an xml file that looks like this:
 <?xml version="1.0" ?>
 <configurations>
 <config
 id="0"
 packetSize="uniform(20,40)"
 interDepartureTime="1"
 firstPacketTime="5"
 trafDest="host[5]"
 onLength="exponential(50)"
 offLength="120"
 offInterDepartureTime="truncnormal(50, 20)"
 onIdenticalTrafDest="true"
 />
 </configurations>

 Multiple traffic patterns can be defined in one xml file by varying the id parameter. The pattern to be used in a specific application can be specified in omnetpp.ini using the parameter defaultTrafConfigId. The traffic pattern can also be changed during the simulation by calling setParams().

 Nodes sending no traffic can be achieved by two methods:
 * setting firstPacketTime to -1 in the xml file
 * setting the parameter defaultTrafConfigId to -1 in the omnetpp.ini file
