	mobility: Fixing bug in StaticConcentricMobility

	The calculation was unnecessary complex, leading to rounding errors
	during the node positioning so nodes were positioned above each other.
	This approach is maybe insignificantly slower, but probably not since the
	sqrt is no longer necessary.

	Added StaticConcentricMobility similar to StaticGridMobility, but it places
	nodes on concentric circles.
