2016-06-15  ------ inet-3.4.0 released ------

2016-05-17  Andras Varga

	Added instrument figures: GaugeFigure, LinearGaugeFigure,
	ProgressMeterFigure, ThermometerFigure, CounterFigure,
	IndicatorLabelFigurea and IndicatorTextFigure. These C++ types
	all implement IIndicatorFigure.

	Instruments display the value set on them via IIndicatorFigure.

	In practice, instrument figures are driven by signals, using a
	@statistic for converting emitted signals into calls to
	IIndicatorFigure's setValue() method. An example:

	  @figure[thruputMeter](type=gauge; pos=50,100; size=150,150);
	  @statistic[dummy](source=throughput; record=figure; targetFigure=thruputMeter);

	The first line adds a figure of the type GaugeFigure to the canvas,
	with the name thruputMeter. The second line adds a special "figure"
	result recorder for the throughput signal. The result recorder
	(see the FigureRecorder C++ class) sends every emitted value
	to the figure denoted by the targetFigure attribute of the
	@statistic, in this case thruputMeter.

	One issue is that @statistic can only add signal listeners to the
	current module (on which the @statistic is declared), but not to
	a submodule or sub-submodule. The workaround for this issue is
	to use a @delegatesignal property to "teleport" the signal from
	its emitted module to the module of the @statistic, under a new
	name. An example:

	  @delegatesignal[rcvdPk](source=hostB.udpApp[0].rcvdPk; target=hostB_rcvdPk);
	  @signal[hostB_rcvdPk];

	The first line adds a listener to the hostB.udpApp[0] submodule for
	the rcvdPk signal, and emits it on the current module as hostB_rcvdPk.
	A @statistic can then use hostB_rcvdPk as its source signal. The
	second, @signal line is necessary because OMNeT++ only allows declared
	signals to be emitted.

	IMPORTANT: When using @delegatesignal, the network must contain a
	DelegateSignalConfigurator module somewhere, because it is what
	processes those properties and makes them work.

	See the Wireless Tutorial (tutorials/wireless) for an example.
