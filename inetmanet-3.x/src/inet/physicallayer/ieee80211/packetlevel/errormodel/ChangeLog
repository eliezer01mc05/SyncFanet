	Ieee80211Consts.h: remove unnecesary includes of it

2015-11-12  Levente Meszaros

	Radio: Added support for the simulation of separate signal parts.

	The preamble, header and data parts can be optionally simulated
	separately. This is results in more accurate simulation, because a
	reception may be aborted before the data part is received.

	Added level parameter to printToStream functions.

	Ieee80211ErrorModelBase, Ieee80211{Nist,Yans}ErrorModel: removed chunk
	mode abstraction.

2015-02-24  Levente Meszaros

	Removed header success rate calculation from Ieee80211BerTableErrorModel.
	The returned packet error rate value should already include all possible
	header errors. Updated fingerprints.

	Refactored 802.11 error models to reflect recent changes in the mode descriptors.
	Introduced bps and Hz units where appropriate. Extracted
	Ieee80211BerTableErrorModel as a separate error model. Removed opMode and
	autoHeaderSize parameters for Ieee80211NistErrorModel and
	Ieee80211YansErrorModel. They rather use the meta data on the transmission.

2015-01-21  Zoltan Bojthe

	Applied C++ source code modernizer.

	cosmetics: space usage made somewhat more consistent throughout the code

	Notes:
	- if you have an INET fork and want to compare the code, use the
	 "Ignore spaces" option of your visual diff tool. Most tools have
	 this option; Meld and Araxis Merge certainly do.

	- I used omnetpp/_scripts/tidymodel/spaces.pl, plus some manual tweaks

2011-05-30  ------ INET-1.99.1 released ------

2011-05-28  Andras Varga

	cosmetics: end-line spaces removed, using spaces.pl in OMNeT++.

2011-05-11  Andras Varga

	Compile fixes for MSVC

	- disambiguate arg types for pow(), sqrt(), etc. (ambiguity caused
	compile errors)
	- added implementations for missing C99 functions
	- MSVC does not have <stdint.h>, but most of its declarations are
	already provided by <omnetpp.h>

2011-04-15  Rudolf Hornig

	Added new ieee802.11 model from INETMANET, supporting a,b,g,p modes.
