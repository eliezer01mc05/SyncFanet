	Radio: IPathLoss: comment

2016-04-19  Levente Meszaros

	Followed recent logging API changes.

2016-05-09  Levente Meszaros

	IPathLoss: Added transmission and arrival to path loss computation interface.

2016-05-04  Levente Meszaros

	All: Removed visualization from various modules. Visualization-related
	code will be moved into separate modules under src/inet/visualization.

2016-06-01  ------ inet-3.3.0 released ------

2016-04-06  ------ inet-3.2.4 released ------

2016-03-16  ------ inet-3.2.3 released ------

2016-01-21  ------ inet-3.2.1 released ------

2015-12-16  ------ inet-3.2.0 released ------

2015-12-08  Levente Meszaros

	Radio: Fixed PER computation in NetworkConfiguratorBase.

	Added computeReceptionIndication to IReceiver interface.

2015-12-08  Levente Meszaros

	Radio: Added some documentation and a few missing overrides.

2015-11-12  Levente Meszaros

	Radio: Added support for the simulation of separate signal parts.

	The preamble, header and data parts can be optionally simulated
	separately. This is results in more accurate simulation, because a
	reception may be aborted before the data part is received.

2015-04-15  Levente Meszaros

	Added snir parameter to computeIsReceptionSuccessful. Added snir parameter
	to computeReceptionDecision.

2015-03-16  Levente Meszaros

	Consistently renamed packet level and bit level implementations into
	separate subdirectories. Renamed contract/layered to contract/bitlevel.
	Moved remaining contract contents to contract/packetlevel.

2015-02-25  Levente Meszaros

	Added new interfaces for analog domain representation of radio signals:
	IRadioSignal, IScalarSignal, IDimensionalSignal

	Extended ITransmission, and IReception interfaces to support optional
	PHY frame representation used by the layered implementation.

2014-12-04  Florian Meier

	Added Arrival to computeReception of IAnalogModel.

2014-11-26  Levente Meszaros

	Added computeIsReceptionSuccessful to IReceiver interface.

	Added initial implementation:
	IAntenna, IArrival, IAttenuation, IBackgroundNoise, IErrorModel,
	IInterference, IListening, IListeningDecision, IModulation, INoise,
	IObstacleLoss, IPathLoss, IPhysicalLayer, IPhysicalLayerFrame,
	IPrintableObject, IPropagation, IRadio, IRadioFrame, IRadioMedium,
	IReceiver, IReception IReceptionDecision, ISNIR, ITransmission, ITransmitter
