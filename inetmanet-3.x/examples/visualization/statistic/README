This example demonstrates how to display a statistic for network nodes.

The ad-hoc wireless network contains 3 source nodes and 1 destination node.
The destination node is stationary, the 3 source nodes move around randomly,
and they continuously ping the destination node.

When you run the example, the statistic visualizer continuously displays the
last ping round trip time at each source node.
