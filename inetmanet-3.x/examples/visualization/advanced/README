This example demonstrates how to use visualizer simple modules on their own, how
to disable visualizer simple modules from the default integrated visualizer, and
how to configure multiple visualizers to display the same simulation in multiple
different ways simultaneously.

The network doesn't contain any communication related modules such as network
nodes. It only contains a physical environment module and one or more visualizer
modules.
