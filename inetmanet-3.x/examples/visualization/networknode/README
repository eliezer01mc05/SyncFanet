This example demonstrates how to display external 3D models for network nodes.
It requires OSG support from OMNeT++ 5.0 or later.

The network contains a number of standard hosts. The network nodes don't communicate
at all, because it's not essential in this example.

When you run the example, you should see a number of very simple 3D animated
humanoid models which represent the nodes in the network.
