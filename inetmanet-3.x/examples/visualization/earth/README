This example demonstrates how to display some part of the Earth in a simulation.
It requires OSG Earth support from OMNeT++ 5.0 or later.

The network doesn't contain any communication related modules. It only contains
two modules: a geographic coordinate system, and a visualizer. 

When you run the example, you should see the detailed map of Boston downtown.
