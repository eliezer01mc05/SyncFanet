This example demonstrates how to display the movement of mobile nodes.

The network contains a number of wireless nodes that just move around randomly.
The network nodes don't communicate at all, because it's not essential in this
example.

When you run the example, you should see a number of wireless nodes moving
around randomly, and you should also see their recent movement trail.
